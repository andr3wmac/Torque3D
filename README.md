Creating a New Project Based on a Template
------------------------------------------

The templates included with Torque 3D provide a starting point for your project.  
Once we have created our own project based on a template, we may then compile an 
executable and begin work on our game.  
The following templates are included in this version of Torque 3D:

* Empty
* Full

### Using PhysX ###
As of 0.3b, basic PhysX 3.3 is integrated as a module.
todo : GMK (asap).

### Using the Project Manager to Create a Project ###

The *Project Manager* may be used to create a new game project based on one of the templates that are included with Greed. 
For now only base Full and Empty templates are available, altough, fps tutorial is probably useable.
